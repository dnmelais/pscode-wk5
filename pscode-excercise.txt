// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1. Start

2. Initialize variables:
   - num1
   - num2
   - sum

3. Read the value of num1
4. Read the value of num2

5. Calculate the sum of num1 and num2:
   - sum = num1 + num2

6. Display the value of sum

7. Stop

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

// Function to check if a number is even or odd
function checkEvenOrOdd(number):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        return "Even"
    else:
        return "Odd"

// Example usage
inputNumber = readIntegerFromUser()
result = checkEvenOrOdd(inputNumber)
print(result)

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1. Initialize sum to 0
2. Initialize minNumber and maxNumber to the first number entered
3. Initialize count to 0
4. Repeat the following steps 5 times:
     a. Read a number from input and store it in variable number
     b. Add number to sum
     c. Increment count by 1
     d. If number is smaller than minNumber, update minNumber
     e. If number is greater than maxNumber, update maxNumber
5. Calculate average by dividing sum by count
6. Print "The average of the five numbers is " concatenated with the value of average
7. Print "The smallest number entered is " concatenated with the value of minNumber
8. Print "The largest number entered is " concatenated with the value of maxNumber
